Simulated interactions of 400+ LLM-powered AI agents (GPT-4o, Gemini, MCP, NetworkX). Designed complex simulations leveraging LLMs to generate and combine text with user behavioral metadata.\n- Record ID 4: Developed a real-time perception system (Meta SAM2, Gemini VLM) for zero-shot segmentation and tracking of dynamic objects. Integrated Gemini 1.5 Flash VLM for scene understanding and object recognition in dynamic environments.\n- Record ID 5: Developed an autonomous agent using behavior trees + CNN for competitive multi-agent simulation. Applied feature engineering, model evaluation, and real-time strategy adaptation across sequential game tasks. Incorporated CNN-based perception module to interpret local observations, enabling the agent to prioritize between harvesting resources, avoiding hazards, and attacking opponents depending on context.\n- Record ID 6: Combined ML, deep learning, and statistical methods with feature engineering for demand forecasting. Built an ensemble model (XGBoost + statistical methods + Transformers) with automated hyperparameter tuning.\n- Record ID 7: Trained reinforcement learning agents (PPO, A2C) for predictive trading, achieving a Sharpe ratio of 1.2. Designed real-time data ingestion pipelines (Scrapy, Airflow, MongoDB, GCP) with 99.95% uptime.\n- Record ID 13: Developed an Agentic AI framework to autonomously collect, synthesize, and predict material properties from scientific literature enabling the design of next generation batteries (Gemini 2.5, LangChain, RAG)\n- Record ID 14: Reduced the design cycle of new materials from weeks to minutes by developing a physics-informed machine learning framework (PyTorch)\n- Record ID 15: Reduced computation time by 5x by developing a computer vision model for 2D image reconstruction (PyTorch, convolutional VAE, Transformer)\n- Record ID 16: Built a structured dataset from 5,000+ collected tweets using PyDantic and LangChain (Prompt Engineering, LangChain).
