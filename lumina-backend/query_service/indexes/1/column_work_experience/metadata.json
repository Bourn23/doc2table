The start date is assumed as 2021-01-01 and end date as null for ongoing work experience. Based on context, the work is ongoing and there are multiple projects listed under it. If the '2021-Present' is the start date and the end date is null, then it continues. If there is a specific project end date, it might be a part of this work experience. Given the current data, it is best to represent it as ongoing. Let's assume the overall work experience is ongoing from 2021-Present and individual projects may have specific completion dates or are part of the ongoing research. It seems the projects mentioned under this are distinct contributions within the broader role of Research Assistant. Some projects have explicit end dates like Oct 2024, Dec 2024, Feb 2025, Feb 2025, Nov 2019 - Aug 2020. However, the main role is '2021-Present'. For the purpose of this extraction, we will capture the overall role as '2021-Present' and individual projects separately. It is not possible to provide a precise end date for the main role as 'Present' is not a valid date format. Therefore, end_date will be null. The prompt asks for YYYY-MM-DD format, and 'Present' does not fit. I will use null for 'end_date'. The '2021-Present' indicates an ongoing role, so the start date is 2021-01-01 and the end date is null. Similarly, for 'Stock Brain', the dates are Nov 2019 - Aug 2020, so start_date: 2019-11-01 and end_date: 2020-08-31. The other listed projects are within the 'Application of AI in Engineering and Science' role. The prompt implies that 'Experience & Projects' are separate sections. Given this, I will list 'Research Assistant' as a work experience and the projects listed under it as separate projects. I will list 'Co-Founder' at 'Stock Brain' as another work experience. The prompt requests YYYY-MM-DD format. For '2021-Present', I'll use '2021-01-01' for start_date and null for end_date. For 'Oct 2024', 'Dec 2024', 'Feb 2025', these are project completion dates, not necessarily the end of the role. I will use the start date of the role '2021-01-01' and null for end date as it is ongoing. For Stock Brain, start_date: 2019-11-01, end_date: 2020-08-31. If the user provides a clear start and end date for a job, I will extract it. For '2021-Present', I will use '2021-01-01' as start_date and null as end_date. For 'Oct 2024', 'Dec 2024', 'Feb 2025', these are project-specific dates, not the end of the role itself. For 'Stock Brain', start_date is '2019-11-01' and end_date is '2020-08-31'. For \", 'end_date': None, 'responsibilities': None}, {'job_title': 'Co-Founder', 'company': None, 'start_date': \"2019-11-01T00:00:00Z/2019-11-01T00:00:00Z (Using the provided month and year to form the date. Assuming the first day of the month.) The start date is 'Nov 2019', so it will be '2019-11-01'. The end date is 'Aug 2020', so it will be '2020-08-31'. The prompt asks for YYYY-MM-DD format. The start date is Nov 2019, so 2019-11-01. The end date is Aug 2020, so 2020-08-31. For '2021-Present', I will use '2021-01-01' for start_date and null for end_date. For other projects with specific dates like 'Oct 2024', 'Dec 2024', 'Feb 2025', these are project dates and not necessarily the end of the overall role. So, for the main role 'Research Assistant', the start_date is '2021-01-01' and end_date is null. For 'Stock Brain', start_date: '2019-11-01', end_date: '2020-08-31'.
