Case Study
Introduction
Des Moines is the capital city of Iowa and sits at the inter-
section of Interstate 35 and Interstate 80. Residents of Des 
Moines enjoy a high quality of life embedded by low unem-
ployment and low housing costs, four seasons of recreation, 
and a vibrant downtown. Des Moines is known for its strong 
corporations in the insurance and agribusiness sector. The 
city embraces a wide variety of cultures integrated into the 
community through festivals and events celebrated through-
out the year. In 2017, Des Moines was recognized for its 
efforts by receiving the World Festival Events Award by the 
International Festivals and Events Association to “recognize 
and fly the flag of those cities and markets who have worked, 
through concerted efforts, to provide an environment con-
ducive to successful festivals and events” (International 
Festivals & Events Association, 2017, para. 1). The success 
of these nationally acclaimed festivals and events can be 
attributed to the enthusiastic engagement and financial sup-
port from the diversification of revenue streams.
Greater Des Moines Partnership (GDMP)
GDMP is the fourth largest chamber in the United States and 
serves the greater Des Moines community. The mission of 
this organization is to drive economic and community devel-
opment with one single voice, mission, and region. The part-
nership has been recognized the Mac Conway Award by Site 
Selection Magazine for its ongoing contribution to economic 
development toward the city. It also collaborates with 
regional partners to attract and assist new and growing busi-
nesses which helps in enhancing employment opportunities 
for the local communities and residents. The organization 
contributes significantly to the prosperity of the stakeholders 
and small businesses, thus promoting quality of life. GDMP 
puts on four events and festivals every year including the 
famous World Food and Music Festival, Holiday Promenade, 
DSM Book Festival, Des Moines Arts Festival, and 
Downtown Des Moines Farmers’ Market as well as provides 
support for numerous other festivals. These events “…mark 
important milestones and achievements, they are deployed 
to celebrate and engage communities, and they are inherent 
aspect of any public occasions” (Pernecky & Luck, 2013, p. 
1). The budget philosophy of these events is to break-even; 
the objectives of these events are to amplify the GDMP mis-
sion of highlighting the economic development of Des 
Moines and to promote its viability as a place to live.

Revenue Diversification for the  
DSM Book Festival: A Strategy for  
Financial Stability
Eric D. Olson, PhD1, Smita Singh, PhD1, and Colleen Murphy, BA2
Abstract
The DSM Book Festival, produced by the Greater Des Moines Partnership (GDMP), is a regional literary event that 
connects book lovers with enhanced content involving interactions with authors, keynote speeches, and other events. 
Although the festival was canceled in 2020 due to the pandemic, it occurred in 2021 in an alternative format. To mitigate 
the financial impact of the 2020 festival, the Downtown Events Director wants to diversity revenue streams for this festival 
for the long-term. This case study examines diversification of festival revenue streams to offset some of the challenges in 
executing the event in a post-COVID environment.

Des Moines Book Festival
The DSM (Des Moines) Book Festival won IFEA’s Gold 
Pinnacle Award for Best New Event in 2019. This is a free 
event and is celebrated every spring. The DSM Book 
Festival had always been a fully sponsored event including 
the participation from major sponsors such as Prairie 
Meadows, Meredith, John Ruan, Kum & Go, Bankers Trust. 
The festival highlights book club discussions by great com-
menters and internationally acclaimed authors, hands-on 
exercises, and games for the children, along with live music 
and drinks. In 2020, the event was cancelled however for 
the year 2021, the festival was held virtually.
After every monumental event (e.g., 9/11, Great 
Recession, and COVID-19), it behooves festival managers 
to evaluate current financial streams of revenue of a festival 
since such monumental events may send shockwaves across 
corporate sponsors, government funding and support, and 
individual giving. This case study examines how the DSM 
Book Festival pivoted from the cancelation of the event in 
2020 due to COVID-19 to offering the event in 2021. We 
argue that revenue diversification can be a powerful tool to 
ensure the success of festivals after monumental events.
Literature Review
Revenue Streams of Non-Profit Organizations
Non-profit organizations maintain their financial stability 
through reliance on grants from government entities, dona-
tions from corporations, and individuals (National Council 
of Nonprofits, 2019). Revenue streams can vary widely 
across different kinds of organizations. For instance, educa-
tional and healthcare organizations receive more than half 
of the revenue from individuals and corporate entities, how-
ever, for other kinds of organizations, earnings from these 
entities are usually the second or the third highest revenue 
generator. Another revenue stream, that is, the funding from 
government is usually half of funding for non-profit organi-
zations (National Council of Nonprofits, 2019).
Why Revenue Diversification Is Necessary?
An event portfolio can be defined as “the strategic pattern-
ing of disparate but interrelated events taking place during 
the course of a year in a host community that as a whole is 
intended to achieve multiple outcomes through the imple-
mentation of joint event strategies” (Ziakas, 2013, p. 14). 
The modern portfolio theory involves the interaction of rev-
enue streams (Qu, 2016), rather than depending upon a 
single source of revenue. An event diversification strategy 
should consider the following dimensions:
••
Flexibility: Revenue diversification is an effective 
technique for reducing risks associated with invest-
ments and increases organizational stability, as a 
reduction in one source of revenue may have an 
impact on other sources of revenue (Bingham & 
Walters, 2013).
••
Autonomy: Revenue diversification reduces resource 
dependency on a single revenue stream and boosts 
autonomy (Mitchell, 2014) by making efficient use 
of resources to carry out the services.
••
Community Connection: Revenue diversification 
helps the organizations to connect to greater set of 
communities, thereby increasing their chances of 
expansion in their mission, vision, and goals.
Revenue Diversification for Festivals and Events
Revenue diversification for events has its roots in the con-
cept of portfolio management and is obtained from Modern 
Financial Portfolio Theory which recommends that invest-
ment portfolios should be optimized to maximize expected 
return while minimizing uncertainty (Markowitz, 1952). 
The modern financial portfolio theory highlights how an 
investor selects an investment portfolio for investments. It 
aids in the identification of an organization's revenue struc-
ture by examining the effect on the return, variance, and 
covariance of revenue streams. The concept of diversifica-
tion has been extended to sectors such as nonprofit organiza-
tions (Chang & Tuckman, 1996), government (White, 1983), 
and other sectors. The revenue streams for festivals and 
events typically relies on admission/ticket fees and sponsor-
ships, and a few other sources, such as media rights, grants, 
and merchandise/food and beverage sales. Therefore, reli-
ance on one source of revenue in such times can result in 
financial strain on the event organizers. Prior research has 
also supported that diversification is vital for well-being of 
the organizations (Carroll & Stater, 2009; Hager, 2001) and 
creates a safety net for the event planners. Chang and 
Tuckman (1991) in a study on non-profits, mentioned reve-
nue concentration as of the indicators of financial vulnera-
bility. Chang and Tuckman (1991) stated that multiple 
revenue streams can help in facing financial shocks by act-
ing like a cushion as disruption to any one stream would be 
less detrimental due to the availability of other revenue 
streams that can be used for operations or to meet other orga-
nizational obligations. In essence, if one revenue stream is 
affected, businesses with more diversified revenue systems 
should be able to use revenue from other sources, resulting 
in greater flexibility and viability. Therefore, revenue diver-
sification can help in reduction of financial risks due to 
COVID-19, making the organization more durable. An 
effective revenue diversification strategy can help in enhanc-
ing relationships with the target audiences and sponsors.
Diversification of Festival Revenue Streams
The economic impact of cancelation and postponement of 
events rose to $809 billion to the U.S. economy, in 2020 


Olson et al.

(Shapiro, 2020). In the month of July 2020, 128,035 U.S 
deaths and 783 Iowa casualties were reported (Tefiowa, 
2020). Many major events in Des Moines were also can-
celed including the famous Iowa State Fair, 80/35 Music 
Festival, and Capitol City Pride. Independent music venues 
in the city like Vaudeville Mews were unable to survive in 
this challenging condition, as emphasized by the owner 
Amedeo Rossi in an interview with The New York Times: 
“We couldn’t pay our rent, and it was piling up, and we 
were constantly still getting drained by internet bill, insur-
ance bill, utility bill,” he said. “Who wants to go into huge 
debt to float a business that we don’t see any end in sight?” 
(Casselman & Tankersley, 2020, para. 15).
The revenue streams for festivals and events typically rely 
on admission/ticket fees and sponsorships, and a few other 
sources, such as media rights, grants, and merchandise/food 
and beverage sales. Therefore, reliance on one source of rev-
enue in such times can result in financial strain on the event 
organizers. Prior research has also supported that diversifica-
tion is vital for well-being of the organizations (Carroll & 
Stater, 2009; Hager, 2001) and creates a safety net for the 
event planners. Chang and Tuckman (1991) in a study on 
non-profits, mentioned revenue concentration as of the indi-
cators of financial vulnerability. He stated that multiple rev-
enue streams can help in facing financial shocks by acting 
like a cushion as disruption to any one stream would be less 
detrimental due to the availability of other revenue streams 
that can be used for operations or to meet other organiza-
tional obligations. In essence, if one revenue stream is 
affected, businesses with more diversified revenue systems 
should be able to use revenue from other sources, resulting in 
greater flexibility and viability. Therefore, revenue diversifi-
cation can help in reduction of financial risks due to COVID-
19, making the organization more durable. An effective 
revenue diversification strategy can help in enhancing rela-
tionships with the target audiences and sponsors.
Book Festivals
Book festivals are community festivals that occur in most 
major metropolitan cities throughout the United States and 
the world and attract many visitors every year. These festi-
vals offer not only attendees ways to interact with book lov-
ers but also offer opportunities to connect with authors, 
books, and their words and ideas. Although the academic 
literature is void of discussion of book festivals, several 
authors have noted the importance of community festivals 
for cities and communities. Community festivals cultivate a 
connection and sense of belonging to place (Brownett & 
Evans, 2020). These festivals often bring in tourists from 
across the country who would not otherwise visit the place 
and help enhance rural communities and improve quality of 
communities (Doe et al., 2021). Community based festivals 
celebrate culture and demonstrate value (O’Toole, 2011) 
and preserve cultural identity of the place (Bladen et al., 
2012; Bowdin et al., 2001).
DSM Book Festival Event in 2020
The 2020 DSM Book Festival, a free, public event, was 
originally scheduled for March 28, 2020 and sponsorship 
was the main revenue source. Three weeks before the event, 
the event organizers cancelled the event as the sponsors 
pulled off as they had concerns about the event due to the 
recent coverage of COVID-19. Table 1 provides a timeline 
of decisions regarding the DSM Book Festival and deci-
sions regarding public health from the state and city.
2021 Event
The 2021 DSM Book Festival was planned as an online 
event and included nationally acclaimed authors, hands-on-
workshops, children’s activities that will be offered in either 
a socially distanced format or in a virtual format. 
Additionally, the festival provided programing across four 
concurrent Saturdays in March and April 2021. A VIP pack-
age included access to a special meeting, an autographed 
book, and enhanced DSM Book Festival merchandise. The 
headline authors for the event include Tayari Jones, author 
of “An American Marriage”; Chuck Kosterman, author of 
“But What if We’re Wrong?”; and Taylor Jenkins Reid, 
author of “Author of “Daisy Jones and the Six.” Confirmed 
sponsors include Prairie Meadows, a local gaming and 
entertainment complex; Des Moines Public Library; Kum 
& Go, a regional convenience store chain; and Polk County. 
Content for children included a kit that could be picked-up 
at a drive-up event and downloadable coloring sheets and 
activities. Table 2 provides an overview of the festival’s 
major content for the four days of the festival.
Table 3 states the preliminary summary of the 2021 fes-
tival outcomes.
Delima
The GDMP is interested in diversifying the current revenue 
streams of DSM Book Festival in order to offset expected 
lower attendance and increased costs affiliated with safety 
and sanitation for this year’s event. This will help better 
position the longevity of the festival for the long-term. The 
challenge will be to identify diverse revenue streams and 
evaluate the revenue streams to examine how DSM Book 
Festival can secure these additional revenue streams.
Diverisfication of Revenue Streams
Traditionally, there are five major streams of revenues for 
events: admission/ticket sales, sponsorship, grants, merchan-
dise sales, and broadcasting. Table 4 states the definitions,

advantages, disadvantages, and implications from COVID-
19 regarding the traditional streams of revenue.
Revenue streams for events during the COVID-19 pan-
demic have been anemic and challenging as a majority of 
face-to-face festivals and special events had been postponed 
or canceled. Many event registrations fees had been reduced 
as events pivoted to virtual events. As a result, since tradi-
tional sources of revenue became challenging, event plan-
ners began experimenting with additional and new sources 
of revenue streams. Examples includes:
VIP areas—VIP areas in events provide access to addi-
tional content or physical space for a premium charge. 
Examples include a VIP lounge with access to refreshments 
space, and restrooms; early access to event programing; and 
enhanced content for VIP attendees (e.g., meeting an enter-
tainer or keynote speaker in an intimate environment).
Post-Event Access to Programing—As numerous events 
shifted to the virtual environment during the Pandemic, 
many events offered their virtual recorded content (e.g., 
keynote speakers, breakout sessions, panelists, and other 
content) so the programing could be streamed after the 
event.
Donations—Contributions from event attendees could 
also be used as a source of revenue. Tactics such as 
“make a contribution” on a website or “donation chan-
nels” at festivals could be created.
Crowd Funding——Many festivals and events use 
crowdfunding tools, such as Kickstarter or GoFundMe 
to raise funds for community-based festivals and events.
Social Content—To continue interaction and cultivat-
ing a sense of community during the Pandemic, many 
festival organizers created virtual content and program-
ing that could be experienced with other event attend-
ees. For example, sponsorship boxes have been sent in 
advanced to a home address and content (e.g., chef or 
wine tasting) could occur at a specific day/time with 
other event attendees.
Big Data—Larger festivals and events often have 
access to a plethora of data points about event attendees, 
including information from registration systems, mobile 
apps, social media engagement, audience engagement 
tools, web analytics, and other tools (Eventsforce, 
2017). Such data can be used to sell insights to sponsors 
or additional firms, pending privacy acknowledgements 
and concerns.

Framework to Evaluate Revenue 
Streams
When evaluating potential new streams of revenue of festi-
vals, a festival manager should consider the following 
dimensions of longevity, accessibility, timeliness, opera-
tional capacity, value alignment, and brand alignment when 
selecting festival revenue streams as shown in Table 5.
Discussion
The major questions poised in this case study are as 
follows:
1.	
What is the importance of having multiple revenue 
streams for a festival in the context of a crisis, such 
as the COVID-19 impact on festivals?
2.	
Are there additional revenue streams that could be 
considered for community-based festivals, such as 
the DSM Book Festival? What are the advantages/
disadvantages of these additional revenue streams?
3.	
Are there additional ways to evaluate potential rev-
enue streams for festivals?
4.	
What skills will an event or festival manager need to 
navigate the complexity of sponsorship manage-
ment in a post-COVID-19 environment?
Activity
You have been asked to present to the executive leadership 
of GDMP that suggests how the DSM Book Festival can 
develop a portfolio of diverse and new revenue streams for 
the festival for the long-term. Creating multiple revenue

for the long term. Such revenue streams should be realistic, 
timely, support the organization’s mission, and align with
